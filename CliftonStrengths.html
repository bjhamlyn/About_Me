    <h1>My Clifton Strength Finder Journey</h1>
    <p>Transitioning service members often find themselves lost after they leave the military. One of the main reasons is that service members
        often derivive much of their identity for their military service. Separating from teh service severs much of that identity. I didn't want 
        to be one of the lost former servicemembers. I researched effective transition tools and found the clifton strengths assessment. The Clifton 
        Strengths assessment is a comprehensive tool designed to uncover an individual's natural talents and provide valuable insights into their 
        unique potential, thereby enabling them to achieve greater success and fulfillment in their personal and professional endeavors.

After taking the 177 question test, I started working with a professional coach who helped me see my attributes for what they were. These were my
top five results: <b>Includer, Communication, Stragetic, Learner, Analytical.  </b> 

   </p>
    <Table>
        <tr>
        <td><blockquote>
            <p><b>Includer:</b>   "Stretch the circle wider." This is the philosophy around which you orient your life. You want to include people 
                and make them feel part of the group. In direct contrast to those who are drawn only to exclusive groups, you actively avoid those 
                groups that exclude others.

                You want to expand the group so that as many people as possible can benefit from its support. You hate the sight of someone on the 
                outside looking in. You want to draw them in so that they can feel the warmth of the group. You are an instinctively accepting 
                person. Regardless of race or sex or nationality or personality or faith, you cast few judgments. Judgments can hurt a person's 
                feelings. Why do that if you don't have to?
                
                Your accepting nature does not necessarily rest on a belief that each of us is different and that one should respect these 
                differences. Rather, it rests on your conviction that fundamentally we are all the same. We are all equally important. Thus, no one 
                should be ignored. Each of us should be included. It is the least we all deserve.</p>

        <tr>
        <td><blockquote>
            <p><b>Communication:</b>    You like to explain, to describe, to host, to speak in public, and to write. This is your Communication theme at work.

                Ideas are a dry beginning. Events are static. You feel a need to bring them to life, to energize them, to make them exciting and vivid. And so 
                you turn events into stories and practice telling them. You take the dry idea and enliven it with images and examples and metaphors.
                
                You believe that most people have a very short attention span. They are bombarded by information, but very little of it survives. You want your 
                information -- whether an idea, an event, a product's features and benefits, a discovery, or a lesson -- to survive. You want to divert their 
                ttention toward you and then capture it, lock it in.
                
                This is what drives your hunt for the perfect phrase. This is what draws you toward dramatic words and powerful word combinations. This is why 
                people like to listen to you. Your word pictures pique their interest, sharpen their world, and inspire them to act.

        <td><blockquote>
            <p><b>Strategic:</b>    Chances are good that you may be inclined to examine the basic elements of certain types of problems. You might attempt to 
                understand how and why things work or fail to work. These insights might stimulate your thinking. Then you try to generate a few alternative plans. 
                Considering prevailing circumstances, available resources, and time constraints, you might narrow down your options. Perhaps the plan that offers 
                the best chance of solving the problem naturally reveals itself. Instinctively, you occasionally marvel at your ability to vividly express your 
                thoughts and feelings. Because of your strengths, you analyze the lessons of the past to find clues for handling future situations. Piecing together 
                the causes and effects of historical events allows you to discover alternate routes to your goal. You are seldom taken by surprise. Why? You probably 
                have studied your options and crafted innovative solutions. Driven by your talents, you long to know more so you remain on the cutting edge of your 
                field or areas of interest. Your inventive mind usually generates more possibilities than you can handle or fund. Nonetheless, you are committed to 
                acquiring knowledge and/or skills. You study everything involved in a situation and conceive entirely new ways of seeing or doing things. What you 
                already know prompts you to ask questions and delve even deeper into a subject or problem. It’s very likely that you may have little difficulty 
                finding the right words at the right time to express what you are thinking or feeling. Maybe you can present your concepts in a reasonable, orderly, 
                or methodical way. Perhaps you generate a few options for others to consider. As a result, certain individuals might say you know how to get your 
                ideas across to people.

            <p><b>Learner:</b>   It’s very likely that you acquire knowledge more easily when you can talk with others about ideas, concepts, or theories.Thoughts 
                come alive for you when questions are posed and answers are proposed. You have a delightful time thinking out loud and listening to intelligent people 
                express themselves. You naturally document or store in your mind bits of discussions. You want to refer back to these insights or facts whenever the 
                opportunity presents itself. Because of and pieces your strengths, you are scholarly, especially when you have an important goal to reach. You are 
                willing to examine relevant topics for extended periods of time. You are determined to satisfy your need for knowledge as well as your desire to make 
                measurable progress. Instinctively, you prefer having quiet time to mull over ideas as well as read and examine interesting topics. Periods of 
                uninterrupted thinking give you great pleasure. You probably excuse yourself from noisy, active, or distracting situations to thoroughly process your 
                ideas. Driven by your talents, you sometimes rely on reason to determine how an event, decision, or condition led to a specific event. Perhaps you 
                desire to understand how things converge to produce the final result. Chances are good that you concentrate for extended periods of time. This is one 
                reason why you ultimately master skills and grasp concepts.</p>

            <p><b>Analytical:</b>  Instinctively, you might deal with certain types of problems in a rational and sensible manner. Maybe you are unemotional when you 
                have critical data or facts to study before choosing a particular course of action. Driven by your talents, you thoroughly examine all the events, 
                actions, data, facts, and evidence that contributed to the current state of affairs. Chances are good that you may rely on reason to enlighten 
                individuals about the intricacies of issues, processes, events, problems, or decisions. You occasionally detect nuances in data or information that 
                certain people overlook. Perhaps you derive some degree of pleasure from bringing particular facts, points, or circumstances to the attention of others.
                It’s very likely that you may be sought out for advice by individuals who appreciate your methodical thinking style. To some extent, your approach prevents people from being distracted by their own or someone else’s emotions. Perhaps you help them concentrate on the facts more than on than their feelings.
                Because of your strengths, you sometimes enjoy thinking about numerical data. Perhaps it appeals to your rational mind. You might prefer listening to someone talk in mathematical terms such as productivity measurements, profit margins, or sports statistics that prove a point. Maybe you become frustrated with those who make emotional pleas but fail to back up their arguments with meaningful numbers.
